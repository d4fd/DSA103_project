Pipeline: 
1.	Activate .venv, import everything from requirements.txt, make sure “DSA103_PROJECT” is the active directory
2.	You run the program via “python scripts/run.py”
3.	The results will be saved in “data/processed” in a .csv format

Some helper functions, also not defined in the original R file, were re-written in Python and are available in “scripts/helper_functions.py.”
